The Problem: Language barriers always exist when you travel in a different country.

The Solution (App): An app that will allow users to understand how to use basic language with pronunciation and everything.

App Design:
-A home screen to start up the app
-A screen to navigate across various languages (Spanish, French, etc.)
-Upon choosing the language necessary, provide a screen of a bunch of common phrases in that language (hello, good-bye, thank you, how are you, etc.)
-Picking a phrase will show how the people would write the phrase in that language, beneath it will show a guide on pronouncing it, with a button that will pronounce the word for you
